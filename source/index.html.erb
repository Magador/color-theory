	<h2>Pick a color <span> hsl($hue, $saturation, $lightness)</span></h2>
	<div class="explanation">
		<div class="test first"></div>
		<p>Pick any color by selecting its hue (0-360) on the color wheel at full saturation (100%) and at half lightness (50%) - this way you start with the 'most colorful color' you can get.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="example">

		<%= partial "partials/mini_layout" %>

	</div>
	<div class="kitty-switch">
		<input type="checkbox" id="toggle">
		<div class="kitty"></div>
		<label for="toggle" class="well"></label>
		<div class="visible">
			<p>Why pick a fully saturated color, but only half lightness?</p>
			<p>Ever mix up a bunch of colors only to end up with a gray blob? In the real world, you can't mix a color to be more saturated - you only "lose" color information as you mix. So, The practice is to start with the most saturated colors at their most chromatic so you can still have a full range of mixing opportunities.</p>

			<p>The complement to any color is always 180 degrees across on the other side of the color wheel. If you've ever wondered why it's the color wheel instead of a color line, this is part of that answer. Remember that the color wheel is our visual documentation for color relationships. <br> Fun fact, if you mix complementary colors, they'll cancel each other out and you'll end up with a neutral gray.</p>

	<h2>Color Relationship Established by Mixing<span>mix( );</h2>
	<div class="explanation">
		<div class="test primary"></div>
		<div class="test complementary"></div>
		<p>Establish a color relationship by mixing them together. As an added bonus, mixing colors desaturates them, further making them look more like something you'd find in nature.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="example">
			<%= partial "partials/mini_layout" %>
		</div>
		<div class="kitty-switch">
			<input type="checkbox" id="toggle">
			<div class="kitty"></div>
			<label for="toggle" class="well"></label>
			<div class="visible">
				<p>Sure, there's a relationship already because these colors are complementary to each other...</p>
				<p>But, this is another way we get closer to nature. It's a bit more complicated than this, but this is my favorite way of explaining it - everything outside has some "yellow" mixed in from the sunshine during the day, and it looks warm and inviting. Same thing happens when everyone and everything looks bad in photos taken under the glow of green flourescent lights - there is green added to all of the colors you're looking at, including adding a green glow to your skin if you're standing under the flourescent light yourself. Whether it looks good or bad, this color (light) mixing creates a visual harmony. We don't really notice it when it's there, but we really notice its absence.</p>
				<p>When you're painting, you want to simulate similar lighting conditions for a scene, and that means mixing a bit of one color into the other. Mixing different ratios of the same colors will usually generate a matching color palette.</p>
				<p>How do I decide what to do? Thanks to art school and science, I know that cool colors are "darker" than warm colors, and will dominate in mixes. For example, a touch of blue will really affect yellow, whereas you can add a lot of yellow to blue before it is very affected. So, here is this thinking in function form. Check if it's a cool color (and will dominate the mix) and then mix the appropriate amount of one color into the other using the handy mix function Sass provides.</p>

		<p>Let your chosen color pop (in other words, don't exhaust your eyes by making them process non-stop intense chromatic colors!) by surrounding it with neturals. Desaturate the natural way: by mixing complementary colors! Then, vary that neutral's lightness to create a highlight and a shadow.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="example example1">
		<%= partial "partials/mini_layout" %>
	</div>
	<div class="explanation">
		<div class="test primary-neutral-light"></div>
		<div class="test primary-neutral"></div>
		<div class="test primary-neutral-dark"></div>
		<p>We can do the same for our primary color too. More neutrals to work with.</p>

	<div class="example example2">
		<%= partial "partials/mini_layout" %>

			<p>The colors are way too intense at their full saturation for our eyes to handle. If all the colors are bright, none of the colors are bright.</p>
			<p>I picked my starting color for a reason -  I want that to be the heart of my design! That means the complementary color should support the chosen color. This means mixing neutrals. Our eyes don't really handle saturated colors very well next to other saturated colors. We have eye cells and they get confused. This is how we get optical illusions. Just give your eyes a break between super strong saturated colors with neutrals so they don't stress out about that much visual information. At the very minimum your viewport should have 30% neutral space (white, desaturated, or black colors) so your poor eyes can have a break and process the information right. Otherwise you get eye strain!</p>
			<p>Here, I decide how much to desaturate - if the color we mixed is already a little more on the 'neutral' side, I don't want it to turn completely grayscale and so I don't desaturate it as much.</p>

	<h2>Why not just desaturate?<span>mix-neutral( ); lighten( ); darken( );</span></h2>
		<p>You totally can! Desaturate does a great job. But, I think my mix-neutral() using mix() does just a tiny bit more to unify these neutral and push them into the background. Remember, you want "ugly" colors for your neutrals! You want to create bland and forgettable colors that recede into the background. These ugly duckling colors are how you get those other call to actions and buttons "pop"!</p>

		<h2>Mix a "White" and "Black"<span>grayscale( ); lighten( ); darken( );</h2>
		<div class="explanation">
			<div class="test white"></div>
			<div class="test black"></div>
			<p>Finally, some contrast! Make sure you don't use pure black or white - this is just like mixing neutrals, just mix them really bright and really dark.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="example">
			<%= partial "partials/mini_layout" %>

				<p>Not everyone sees color the same. Accessibility is important, and it's good for everyone. Increasing contrast is one of the ways you can immediately improve your design on all levels. Your layout should work when you take out ALL of the color information (desaturate it all, take out all of the hue information, and leave only lightness and darkness to differentiate between areas). Just about every famous master painting still looks amazing if you desaturate the whole thing. </p>
				<p>Yes, people will notice. #000000 and #ffffff will irritate your eyes. Mix up a matching white and a matching gray from your ever expanding palette and you will ensure that it will always match the rest of your design.</p>

			<div class="test primary-dark"></div>
			<p>This is the color you wanted in the first place, make sure you're using it. But, remember that it's about context - make sure you're using the right amount of contrast! The header on our little layout has a lighter version of our primary color.</p>
			<p>Overall, this is a pretty simple setup - but it's an example of what you can do with just one color, some design knowhow, and some Sass functions.</p>

				<p>That's right, the pattern you may be noticing is that you can use what you've already got to mix up more colors and keep building those color relationships. These colors can be achieved just by adjusting lightness and darkness. Up to you!</p>
				<p>A lighter and darker version of your primary color is useful for things like hover states. </p>

		</div>
		<p>There is so much more to color than just "hue"! Value - the visible lightness or darkness of a color is incredibly important to consider when creating a color palette. Color is light.

					<p>Remember: When you mix colors, you should create relationships. Remember, color theory is a design pattern - logical and predictable! Learn the patterns, and play with Sass functions - they're a great tool!!</p>
